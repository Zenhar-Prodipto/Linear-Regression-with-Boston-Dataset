# Linear-Regression-with-Boston-Dataset
Used Boston dataset from sklearn datasets, applied feature engineering and explored the data and then used linear regression to predict.  Excluded few columns and normalized the dataframe and then applied Linear Regression again and compared MSE, RMSE and R2 of the two dataframes.
